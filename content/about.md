## About

**Hi there! I'm Joydeep Bhattacharya**, a developer from West Bengal, India, who's been turning caffeine into code since my GW-BASIC days on an 8-bit console.

I wrote my first "Hello World" in GW-BASIC on an 8-bit video game console. Today, I'm still saying hello to the world—just with more Golang, Node.js, and significantly better coffee.

As a polyglot developer and technology enthusiast with close to a decade in the industry, I spend my days building backend systems that (usually) don't break at 3 AM, tinkering with AI to make it behave better, and occasionally having philosophical discussions with databases about trust and reliability. My passion lies in crafting efficient and scalable software solutions, primarily with Golang and Node.js, though I'm always game for learning the next shiny language that catches my eye.

When I'm not deep in code, you might find me strumming my guitar (still working on that first perfect solo!), diving into games, or exploring new languages—both human and programming ones. There's something beautifully chaotic about constantly learning, whether it's a new framework or attempting to order coffee in a different language.

This is where I document the beautiful chaos of software development—the victories, the 2 AM debugging sessions, the "it worked on my machine" mysteries, and everything in between. Whether you're here for the technical deep dives, AI adventures, or just want to commiserate about why your perfectly good code suddenly decided to take a vacation, welcome to my corner of the internet.

**Currently breaking things with:** Go, Node.js, AI/ML pipelines, distributed systems, and whatever shiny new framework caught my attention this week.
