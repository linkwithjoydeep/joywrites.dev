I wrote my first "Hello World" in GW-BASIC on an 8-bit video game console. Today, I'm still saying hello to the world—just with more Golang, Node.js, and significantly better coffee.

I build backend systems that (usually) don't break at 3 AM, tinker with distributed architectures, and occasionally convince databases to behave. Between deployments, you'll catch me learning my fifth programming language or attempting to master my first guitar solo.

This is where I document the beautiful chaos of software development—the victories, the 2 AM debugging sessions, and everything in between.
